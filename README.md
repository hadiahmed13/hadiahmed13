## My Ghibli-Inspired Journey

Like the gentle breeze that sweeps through a Studio Ghibli meadow, my path in tech has been one of curiosity, creativity, and continuous learning. I’m currently immersed in the world of computer science at the University of Toronto, enjoying every moment of exploration—from building projects in React to tinkering with neural networks in TensorFlow.

When I’m not coding:
- You might find me watching a Formula 1 race (always rooting for a close finish).
- Kicking a soccer ball around the pitch with friends.
- Hitting the gym to stay active and focused.
- Watching a great animated show or discovering new facets of Japanese culture.
